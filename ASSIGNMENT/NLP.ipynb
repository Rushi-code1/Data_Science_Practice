harmful fuel injection system never use additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol additive may damage fuel system car carbs almost certainly damage car fuel injection manufacturer

    "### Summary\n",
    "In this notebook, we performed natural language processing tasks on a dataset containing text data. We began by importing essential libraries for data handling, preprocessing, visualization, and model training. After loading the dataset, we explored it through basic methods such as checking for duplicates and converting categorical labels to numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset underwent preprocessing steps like text vectorization using TF-IDF, which captures the importance of words across documents. Finally, we implemented a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification and visualized key insights using word clouds and other plotting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This notebook provided a comprehensive pipeline for text classification, demonstrating key preprocessing, feature extraction, and modeling steps. The Naive Bayes classifier is a straightforward yet powerful tool for handling text classification tasks, and visualization techniques like word clouds offer an intuitive understanding of word distributions in the dataset. Future work could involve experimenting with different classifiers and optimizing the preprocessing pipeline to improve accuracy.\n"
