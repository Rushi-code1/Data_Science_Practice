    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "- **Goal**: Clearly define the problem or research question. \n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "  - Understanding stakeholder requirements.\n",
    "  - Translating business problems into data-driven objectives.\n",
    "  - Defining success metrics for the project.\n",
    "- **Example**: \"How can we predict customer churn in a subscription-based service?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Collection\n",
    "- **Goal**: Gather relevant data from various sources.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "  - Collect data from databases, APIs, web scraping, surveys, sensors, etc.\n",
    "  - Identifying relevant internal and external data sources.\n",
    "  - Ensuring data availability and sufficiency for solving the problem.\n",
    "- **Example**: Collecting customer demographics, transaction logs, and usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Preparation (Data Wrangling)\n",
    "- **Goal**: Clean and transform the data into a usable format.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "  - Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.\n",
    "  - Data transformation (e.g., normalization, scaling, feature encoding).\n",
    "  - Splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets.\n",
    "- **Example**: Removing invalid records, dealing with null values, and encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- **Goal**: Understand the data and uncover patterns or trends.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.).\n",
    "  - Data visualization (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots).\n",
    "  - Identifying correlations and relationships between variables.\n",
    "- **Example**: Plotting customer churn rates against demographic factors to find key patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Feature Engineering\n",
    "- **Goal**: Create new features or select important ones to improve model performance.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "  - Deriving new variables from existing data (e.g., creating age groups from birth dates).\n",
    "  - Feature scaling, transformation, and selection.\n",
    "  - Reducing dimensionality (e.g., PCA or feature selection techniques).\n",
    "- **Example**: Creating a new feature \"customer tenure\" from signup date and current date.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Modeling\n",
    "- **Goal**: Build machine learning or statistical models to make predictions.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "  - Selecting appropriate algorithms (e.g., regression, decision trees, neural networks).\n",
    "  - Training the model on the training dataset.\n",
    "  - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.\n",
    "- **Example**: Training a Random Forest model to predict customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Model Evaluation\n",
    "- **Goal**: Assess the model's performance and validate its effectiveness.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "  - Using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC curve.\n",
    "  - Cross-validation to assess model stability.\n",
    "  - Comparing model performance with a baseline or alternative models.\n",
    "- **Example**: Evaluating the predictive accuracy of the churn model using test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Model Deployment\n",
    "- **Goal**: Implement the model in production to make real-time or batch predictions.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "  - Integrating the model into the production environment (e.g., web services, APIs).\n",
    "  - Ensuring scalability and efficiency for large datasets.\n",
    "  - Monitoring model performance over time for accuracy drift.\n",
    "- **Example**: Deploying a churn prediction model to trigger retention offers to customers at risk of leaving.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Model Monitoring and Maintenance\n",
    "- **Goal**: Continuously monitor the model to ensure it performs well over time.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "  - Tracking performance metrics and detecting model drift.\n",
    "  - Re-training the model periodically with new data.\n",
    "  - Updating the model as business needs evolve.\n",
    "- **Example**: Monitoring the accuracy of the churn model and updating it quarterly as new customer data becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Communication of Results\n",
    "- **Goal**: Present findings and insights to stakeholders.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
