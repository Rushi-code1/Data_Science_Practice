    "# Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make decisions based on patterns or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data**: The foundation of machine learning. Data can be in the form of numbers, text, images, or other inputs that can be processed by an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Features**: Specific properties or characteristics of the data that are used by the machine learning model to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Label**: The output or target variable in supervised learning. For example, in a spam email classifier, the label is either \"spam\" or \"not spam\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Algorithm**: The method used to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Common algorithms include decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model**: The output of the machine learning algorithm after training on the data. The model is used to make predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to desired outputs. Examples include:\n",
    "   - Classification (e.g., identifying spam emails)\n",
    "   - Regression (e.g., predicting house prices)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The model is trained on data that is not labeled, and it tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data. Examples include:\n",
    "   - Clustering (e.g., grouping customers by purchasing behavior)\n",
    "   - Dimensionality reduction (e.g., reducing the number of features in the dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with its environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, and optimizing its strategy to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Examples include:\n",
    "   - Game playing (e.g., AI in video games)\n",
    "   - Robotics (e.g., a robot learning to navigate a space)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Popular Machine Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression**: Used for regression tasks where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable (e.g., predicting sales based on past data).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression**: Used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict a binary outcome (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision Trees**: A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into branches to make a decision based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Neural Networks**: A set of algorithms modeled after the human brain, capable of handling complex tasks like image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Machine learning is used for tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.\n",
    "- **Computer Vision**: Applications include facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous vehicles.\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Predicting diseases, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.\n",
    "- **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Data**: The data used to train the machine learning model.\n",
    "- **Test Data**: The data used to evaluate the performance of the model.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, leading to poor performance on new data.\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: When a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying pattern of the data, resulting in poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a powerful technology with a wide range of applications across various industries. By leveraging data and sophisticated algorithms, machines can learn to perform complex tasks, automate processes, and make intelligent decisions.\n",

    "### Definition\n",
    "Linear regression is a linear model that predicts a continuous output variable based on one or more predictor variables.\n",

    "### Types\n",
    "1. **Simple Linear Regression**: Simple linear regression involves one independent variable to predict the outcome of one dependent variable.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Multiple linear regression involves more than one independent variable to predict the outcome of one dependent variable.\n",
    "3. **Polynomial Linear Regression**: Polynomial linear regression involves one independent variable with degree greater than one to predict the outcome of one dependent variable.\n",
